<h1>MAHENDRA SINGH DHONI - The Legend</h1>
In a test match,
Maybe white,
He'll make haters quiet.

In the world cup,
May be blue,
He'll leave us in awe.

In IPL,
Maybe yellow,
He'll make us follow.

Jersey colour doesn't matter,
When his no. in Jersey matters.
Much more than anything,
When he's no.7,
When he's MSD.

If the last ball is six,
Then please fix,
In your mind.
He's a kind,
Of cool man,
Called MSD.
